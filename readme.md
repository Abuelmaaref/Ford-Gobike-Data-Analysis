# Ford Gobike Data Analysis
## by Mohamed Abuelmaaref


## Dataset

> The dataset that I am doing analysis on is Ford GoBike dataset about trips recordings of year 2019 february month. Which has records for each trip in details, Time, location, user type, gender, age, and trip duration.

## Summary of Findings

>Age had values up to 141 which is not realistic, So I dropped all values above the 99% point which was 64 years.
>Number of trips starts to rise up at 7 Am at the morning till 10 AM and then dropped down a little bit then it goes up from 4 PM to 7 PM and they dropped down slowly till midnight.
>Number of trips goes down on weekends. While on weekends also average trip duration is higher than normal days, which I showed in the presentation.
>99% of the trips Do not go above one hour so I have dropped the data for trips over one hour. 50% of trips go below 10 minutes.
>Females and others genders tend to spend more time on trips than males. While males have the highest trip numbers. While males tend to do more trips than other genders, which I showed in the presentation.
>Subscribers spend less time in trips and also do less trips in total which is great business wise, which I showed in the presentation.

## Key Insights for Presentation

>One of the the main topics of presentation is gender based analysis, in which I discovered that males has more trip records than other genders, which is normal since there are more records about males than other genders. In my openion if there was more trips recordings of the other genders it would enable more analysis on data to analyize the fact that they tend to spend more time than males in trips.
